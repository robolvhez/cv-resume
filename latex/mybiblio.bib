  abstract = {Human DNA polymorphisms vary across geographic regions, with the most commonly observed variation reflecting distant ancestry differences. Here we investigate the geographic clustering of common genetic variants that influence complex traits in a sample of \textasciitilde 450,000 individuals from Great Britain. Of 33 traits analysed, 21 showed significant geographic clustering at the genetic level after controlling for ancestry, probably reflecting migration driven by socioeconomic status (SES). Alleles associated with educational attainment (EA) showed the most clustering, with EA-decreasing alleles clustering in lower SES areas such as coal mining areas. Individuals who leave coal mining areas carry more EA-increasing alleles on average than those in the rest of Great Britain. The level of geographic clustering is correlated with genetic associations between complex traits and regional measures of SES, health and cultural outcomes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that social stratification leaves visible marks in geographic arrangements of common allele frequencies and gene–environment correlations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social inequalities in adult mortality have been reported across diverse populations, but there is no large-scale prospective evidence from Mexico. We aimed to quantify social, including educational, inequalities in mortality among adults in Mexico City. METHODS: The Mexico City Prospective Study recruited 150\hphantom{,}000 adults aged 35 years and older from two districts of Mexico City between 1998 and 2004. Participants were followed up until Jan 1, 2021 for cause-specific mortality. Cox regression analysis yielded rate ratios (RRs) for death at ages 35-74 years associated with education and examined, in exploratory analyses, the mediating effects of lifestyle and related risk factors. FINDINGS: Among 143\hphantom{,}478 participants aged 35-74 years, there was a strong inverse association of education with premature death. Compared with participants with tertiary education, after adjustment for age and sex, those with no education had about twice the mortality rate (RR 1·84; 95\% CI 1·71-1·98), equivalent to approximately 6 years lower life expectancy, with an RR of 1·78 (1·67-1·90) among participants with incomplete primary, 1·62 (1·53-1·72) with complete primary, and 1·34 (1·25-1·42) with secondary education. Education was most strongly associated with death from renal disease and acute diabetic crises (RR 3·65; 95\% CI 3·05-4·38 for no education vs tertiary education) and from infectious diseases (2·67; 2·00-3·56), but there was an apparent higher rate of death from all specific causes studied with lower education, with the exception of cancer for which there was little association. Lifestyle factors (ie, smoking, alcohol drinking, and leisure time physical activity) and related physiological correlates (ie, adiposity, diabetes, and blood pressure) accounted for about four-fifths of the association of education with premature mortality. INTERPRETATION: In this Mexican population there were marked educational inequalities in premature adult mortality, which appeared to largely be accounted for by lifestyle and related risk factors. Effective interventions to reduce these risk factors could reduce inequalities and have a major impact on premature mortality.

  abstract = {Background Diabetes is presently classified into two main forms, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but type 2 diabetes in particular is highly heterogeneous. A refined classification could provide a powerful tool to individualise treatment regimens and identify individuals with increased risk of complications at diagnosis. Methods We did data-driven cluster analysis (k-means and hierarchical clustering) in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes (n=8980) from the Swedish All New Diabetics in Scania cohort. Clusters were based on six variables (glutamate decarboxylase antibodies, age at diagnosis, BMI, HbA1c, and homoeostatic model assessment 2 estimates of β-cell function and insulin resistance), and were related to prospective data from patient records on development of complications and prescription of medication. Replication was done in three independent cohorts: the Scania Diabetes Registry (n=1466), All New Diabetics in Uppsala (n=844), and Diabetes Registry Vaasa (n=3485). Cox regression and logistic regression were used to compare time to medication, time to reaching the treatment goal, and risk of diabetic complications and genetic associations. Findings We identified five replicable clusters of patients with diabetes, which had significantly different patient characteristics and risk of diabetic complications. In particular, individuals in cluster 3 (most resistant to insulin) had significantly higher risk of diabetic kidney disease than individuals in clusters 4 and 5, but had been prescribed similar diabetes treatment. Cluster 2 (insulin deficient) had the highest risk of retinopathy. In support of the clustering, genetic associations in the clusters differed from those seen in traditional type 2 diabetes. Interpretation We stratified patients into five subgroups with differing disease progression and risk of diabetic complications. This new substratification might eventually help to tailor and target early treatment to patients who would benefit most, thereby representing a first step towards precision medicine in diabetes.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. AD is highly heritable, with heritability estimates of ∼70\% from twin studies. Progressively larger genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have continued to expand our knowledge of AD/dementia genetic architecture. Until recently these efforts had identified 39 disease susceptibility loci in European ancestry populations. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: Two new AD/dementia GWAS have dramatically expanded the sample sizes and the number of disease susceptibility loci. The first increased total sample size to 1,126,563-with an effective sample size of 332,376-by predominantly including new biobank and population-based dementia datasets. The second, expands on an earlier GWAS from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) by increasing the number of clinically-defined AD cases/controls in addition to incorporating biobank dementia datasets, resulting in a total sample size to 788,989 and an effective sample size of 382,472. Collectively both GWAS identified 90 independent variants across 75 AD/dementia susceptibility loci, including 42 novel loci. Pathway analyses indicate the susceptibility loci are enriched for genes involved in amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, cholesterol metabolism, endocytosis/phagocytosis, and the innate immune system. Gene prioritization efforts for the novel loci identified 62 candidate causal genes. Many of the candidate genes from known and newly discovered loci play key roles in macrophages and highlight phagocytic clearance of cholesterol-rich brain tissue debris by microglia (efferocytosis) as a core pathogenetic hub and putative therapeutic target for AD. WHERE NEXT?: While GWAS in European ancestry populations have substantially enhanced our understanding of AD genetic architecture, heritability estimates from population based GWAS cohorts are markedly smaller than those from twin studies. While this missing heritability is likely due to a combination of factors, it highlights that our understanding of AD genetic architecture and genetic risk mechanisms remains incomplete. These knowledge gaps result from several underexplored areas in AD research. First, rare variants remain understudied due to methodological issues in identifying them and the cost of generating sufficiently powered whole exome/genome sequencing datasets. Second, sample sizes of non-European ancestry populations in AD GWAS remain small. Third, GWAS of AD neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid endophenotypes remains limited due to low compliance and high costs associated with measuring amyloid-β and tau levels and other disease-relevant biomarkers. Studies generating sequencing data, including diverse populations, and incorporating blood-based AD biomarkers are set to substantially improve our knowledge of AD genetic architecture.},

  abstract = {The term “biobanking” is often misapplied to any collection of human biological materials (biospecimens) regardless of requirements related to ethical and legal issues or the standardization of different processes involved in tissue collection. A proper definition of biobanks is large collections of biospecimens linked to relevant personal and health information (health records, family history, lifestyle, genetic information) that are held predominantly for use in health and medical research. In addition, the International Organization for Standardization, in illustrating the requirements for biobanking (ISO 20387:2018), stresses the concept of biobanks being legal entities driving the process of acquisition and storage together with some or all of the activities related to collection, preparation, preservation, testing, analysing and distributing defined biological material as well as related information and data. In this review article, we aim to discuss the basic principles of biobanking, spanning from definitions to classification systems, standardization processes and documents, sustainability and ethical and legal requirements. We also deal with emerging specimens that are currently being generated and shaping the so-called next-generation biobanking, and we provide pragmatic examples of cancer-associated biobanking by discussing the process behind the construction of a biobank and the infrastructures supporting the implementation of biobanking in scientific research.},

Yet all large studies mapping genomes to complex traits occur in populations that have experienced the Out-of-Africa bottleneck. Does this bottleneck affect the way we characterise complex traits? We demonstrate using the 1000 Genomes dataset and hypothetical complex traits that genetic drift can strongly affect the joint distribution of effect size and SNP frequency, and that the bias can be positive or negative depending on subtle details. Characterisations that rely on this distribution therefore conflate genetic drift and selection. We provide a model to identify the underlying selection parameter in the presence of drift, and demonstrate that a simple sensitivity analysis may be enough to validate existing characterisations. We conclude that biobanks characterising more worldwide diversity would benefit studies of complex traits.},

Opportunities for IGE are ubiquitous, and, when present, IGE have profound implications for behavioral, evolutionary, agricultural, and biomedical genetics. Despite their importance, the empirical study of IGE lags behind the development of theory. In large part, this lag can be attributed to the fact that measuring IGE, and deconvoluting them from the direct genetic effects of an individual’s own genotype, is subject to many potential pitfalls. In this Perspective, we describe current challenges that empiricists across all disciplines will encounter in measuring and understanding IGE. Using ideas and examples spanning evolutionary, agricultural, and biomedical genetics, we also describe potential solutions to these challenges, focusing on opportunities provided by recent advances in genomic, monitoring, and phenotyping technologies.

  abstract = {Many complex traits studied in genetics have markedly non-normal distributions. This often implies that the assumption of normally distributed residuals has been violated. Recently, inverse normal transformations (INTs) have gained popularity among genetics researchers and are implemented as an option in several software packages. Despite this increasing use, we are unaware of extensive simulations or mathematical proofs showing that INTs have desirable statistical properties in the context of genetic studies. We show that INTs do not necessarily maintain proper Type 1 error control and can also reduce statistical power in some circumstances. Many alternatives to INTs exist. Therefore, we contend that there is a lack of justification for performing parametric statistical procedures on INTs with the exceptions of simple designs with moderate to large sample sizes, which makes permutation testing computationally infeasible and where maximum likelihood testing is used. Rigorous research evaluating the utility of INTs seems warranted.},

The original settlement by indigenous Americans, followed by postcolonial admixture from multiple continents, has yielded localized genetic patterns. In addition, numerous H/L populations appear to have signatures of pre-colonization and post-colonization bottlenecks, indicating that tens of millions of H/Ls may harbor signatures of founder effects today. Based on both population and medical genetic findings we highlight the extreme differentiation across the Americas, providing evidence for why H/Ls should not be considered a single population in modern human genetics. We highlight the need for additional sampling of understudied H/L groups, and ramifications of these findings for genomic medicine in one-tenth of the world’s population.},

It identifies three strands in the genealogy of this policy arena—the International Haplotype Mapping Project as a model and foil for postcolonial genomics; an emerging public health genomics field which stands in contrast to Western pursuits of personalized medicine; and North American drug companies increased focus on ethnic drug markets. I conceptualize postcolonial genomics as a nationalist project with contradictory tendencies—unifying and differentiating a diverse body politic, cultivating national scientific and commercial autonomy and dependence upon global knowledge networks and foreign capital. It argues that the ‘strategic calibration’ of socio-political versus biological taxonomies in postcolonial genomics creates two primary challenges for this arena, which I refer to heuristically as dilemmas of mapping and marketing.},

These analyses used height effect estimates from the GIANT consortium and replication studies. Here, we describe a new analysis based on the the UK Biobank (UKB), a large, independent dataset. We find that the signals of selection using UKB effect estimates are strongly attenuated or absent. We also provide evidence that previous analyses were confounded by population stratification. Therefore, the conclusion of strong polygenic adaptation now lacks support. Moreover, these discrepancies highlight (1) that methods for correcting for population stratification in GWAS may not always be sufficient for polygenic trait analyses, and (2) that claims of differences in polygenic scores between populations should be treated with caution until these issues are better understood.

However, all marker-based heritability estimators implicitly assume mating is random. We provide mathematical and simulation-based evidence demonstrating that both method-of-moments and likelihood-based estimators are biased in the presence of assortative mating and derive corrected heritability estimators for traits subject to assortment. Finally, we demonstrate that the empirical patterns of estimates across methods and sample sizes for real traits subject to assortative mating are congruent with expected assortative mating-induced biases. For example, marker-based heritability estimates for height are 14\% – 23\% higher than corrected estimates using UK Biobank data.},

In analyses of rare variants, corrections based on principal components (PCs) and linear mixed models (LMMs) yield conflicting conclusions. Studies evaluating these approaches generally focused on limited types of structure and large sample sizes. We investigated the properties of several correction methods through a large simulation study using real exome data, and several within- and between-continent stratification scenarios. We considered different sample sizes, with situations including as few as 50 cases, to account for the analysis of rare disorders. Large samples showed that accounting for stratification was more difficult with a continental than with a worldwide structure. When considering a sample of 50 cases, an inflation of type-I-errors was observed with PCs for small numbers of controls (≤\,100), and with LMMs for large numbers of controls (≥\,1000). We also tested a novel local permutation method (LocPerm), which maintained a correct type-I-error in all situations. Powers were equivalent for all approaches pointing out that the key issue is to properly control type-I-errors. Finally, we found that power of analyses including small numbers of cases can be increased, by adding a large panel of external controls, provided an appropriate stratification correction was used.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although higher risks of infectious diseases among individuals with diabetes have long been recognized, the magnitude of these risks is poorly described, particularly in lower income settings. This study sought to assess the risk of death from infection associated with diabetes in Mexico. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2004, a total of 159\,755 adults ≥35 years were recruited from Mexico City and followed up until January 2021 for cause-specific mortality. Cox regression yielded adjusted rate ratios (RR) for death due to infection associated with previously diagnosed and undiagnosed (HbA1c ≥6.5\%) diabetes and, among participants with previously diagnosed diabetes, with duration of diabetes and with HbA1c. RESULTS: Among 130\,997 participants aged 35-74 and without other prior chronic diseases at recruitment, 12.3\% had previously diagnosed diabetes, with a mean (SD) HbA1c of 9.1\% (2.5\%), and 4.9\% had undiagnosed diabetes. During 2.1 million person-years of follow-up, 2030 deaths due to infectious causes were recorded at ages 35-74. Previously diagnosed diabetes was associated with an RR for death from infection of 4.48 (95\% CI 4.05-4.95), compared with participants without diabetes, with notably strong associations with death from urinary tract (9.68 (7.07-13.3)) and skin, bone and connective tissue (9.19 (5.92-14.3)) infections and septicemia (8.37 (5.97-11.7)). In those with previously diagnosed diabetes, longer diabetes duration (1.03 (1.02-1.05) per 1 year) and higher HbA1c (1.12 (1.08-1.15) per 1.0\%) were independently associated with higher risk of death due to infection. Even among participants with undiagnosed diabetes, the risk of death due to infection was nearly treble the risk of those without diabetes (2.69 (2.31-3.13)). CONCLUSIONS: In this study of Mexican adults, diabetes was common, frequently poorly controlled, and associated with much higher risks of death due to infection than observed previously, accounting for approximately one-third of all premature mortality due to infection.},

Here we describe methods for within-family Mendelian randomization analyses and use simulation studies to show that family-based analyses can reduce such biases. We illustrate empirically how familial effects can affect estimates using data from 61,008 siblings from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and UK Biobank and replicated our findings using 222,368 siblings from 23andMe. Both Mendelian randomization estimates using unrelated individuals and within family methods reproduced established effects of lower BMI reducing risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. However, while Mendelian randomization estimates from samples of unrelated individuals suggested that taller height and lower BMI increase educational attainment, these effects were strongly attenuated in within-family Mendelian randomization analyses. Our findings indicate the necessity of controlling for population structure and familial effects in Mendelian randomization studies.},

The major challenges preventing estimation of genetic correlation from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with current methods are the lack of availability of individual genotype data and widespread sample overlap among meta-analyses. We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique – cross-trait LD Score regression – for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use this method to estimate 276 genetic correlations among 24 traits. The results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia, anorexia and obesity and associations between educational attainment and several diseases. These results highlight the power of genome-wide analyses, since there currently are no significantly associated SNPs for anorexia nervosa and only three for educational attainment.},

  abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure-outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined ∼2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of ∼3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P\,{$<$}\,5\,×\,10-7: 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn’s disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10-5 and 5\,×\,10-7) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.},

  abstract = {The effective size of a population, Ne, determines the rate of change in the composition of a population caused by genetic drift, which is the random sampling of genetic variants in a finite population. Ne is crucial in determining the level of variability in a population, and the effectiveness of selection relative to drift.There are three major ways by which the rate of genetic drift can be modelled in the simplest type of population: increase in variance of allele frequencies; approach to identity by descent of all alleles; and coalescence of a sample of alleles into an ancestral allele.A general method for calculating Ne has been developed using coalescent theory for populations in which there are several 'compartments' (for example, ages or sexes) in the population from which alleles can be sampled. This involves the fast timescale approximation, in which the flow of alleles between compartments is faster than the rate of coalescence.Formulae are presented for the effects on Ne of differences in numbers of breeding males and females, differences in variance of offspring number between males and females, levels of inbreeding, changes in population size and modes of inheritance.Methods for estimating Ne for natural and artificial populations are described, using both demographic and genetic approaches. Examples of the results of the application of these methods are presented.The theory of how selection operates in a finite population is outlined, based on the formula for the probabilities of fixation of favourable and deleterious mutations. These depend on the product of the selection coefficient and Ne.There are data that show that the level of molecular sequence adaptation is reduced when Ne is low, as predicted from the product of the selection coefficient and Ne.The problem of describing neutral variability and the outcome of selection in a spatially or genetically structured population is discussed. A great simplification occurs when there is a large number of local populations in a structured metapopulation.Selection at one or more sites in the genome can influence the value of Ne at other, genetically linked sites by several mechanisms. Balancing selection can elevate Ne, whereas positive selection and purifying selection reduce it.Data on molecular variation and evolution are described, which are consistent with these theoretical predictions.},

The recent~emergence of new technologies and the remarkable scale of~sequence-based population studies have begun to crystalize our understanding of SVs as a mutational class and their widespread influence across phenotypes. In this Review, we summarize recent discoveries and new insights into SVs in the human genome in terms of their mutational patterns, population genetics, functional consequences, and impact on human traits and disease.

Here we introduce a coalescence-based hidden Markov model, cobraa, that explicitly represents an ancestral population split and rejoin, and demonstrate its application on simulated and real data across multiple species. Using cobraa, we present evidence for an extended period of structure in the history of all modern humans, in which two ancestral populations that diverged \textasciitilde 1.5 million years ago came together in an admixture event \textasciitilde 300 thousand years ago, in a ratio of \textasciitilde 80:20\%. Immediately after their divergence, we detect a strong bottleneck in the major ancestral population. We inferred regions of the present-day genome derived from each ancestral population, finding that material from the minority correlates strongly with distance to coding sequence, suggesting it was deleterious against the majority background. Moreover, we found a strong correlation between regions of majority ancestry and human–Neanderthal or human–Denisovan divergence, suggesting the majority population was also ancestral to those archaic humans.},

  abstract = {Metabolic diseases and their complications impose health and economic burdens worldwide. Evidence from past experimental studies and clinical trials suggests our body may have the ability to remember the past metabolic environment, such as hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia, thus leading to chronic inflammatory disorders and other diseases even after the elimination of these metabolic environments. The long-term effects of that aberrant metabolism on the body have been summarized as metabolic memory and are found to assume a crucial role in states of health and disease. Multiple molecular mechanisms collectively participate in metabolic memory management, resulting in different cellular alterations as well as tissue and organ dysfunctions, culminating in disease progression and even affecting offspring. The elucidation and expansion of the concept of metabolic memory provides more comprehensive insight into pathogenic mechanisms underlying metabolic diseases and complications and promises to be a new target in disease detection and management. Here, we retrace the history of relevant research on metabolic memory and summarize its salient characteristics. We provide a detailed discussion of the mechanisms by which metabolic memory may be involved in disease development at molecular, cellular, and organ levels, with emphasis on the impact of epigenetic modulations. Finally, we present some of the pivotal findings arguing in favor of targeting metabolic memory to develop therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases and provide the latest reflections on the consequences of metabolic memory as well as their implications for human health and diseases.},

  abstract = {Objective: Gene scores are often used to model the combined effects of genetic variants. When variants are in linkage disequilibrium, it is common to prune all variants except the most strongly associated. This avoids duplicating information but discards information when variants have independent effects. However, joint modelling of correlated variants increases the sampling error in the gene score. In recent applications, joint modelling has offered only small improvements in accuracy over pruning. We aimed to quantify the relationship between pruning and joint modelling in relation to sample size. Methods: We derived the coefficient of determination R2 for a gene score constructed from pruned markers, and for one constructed from correlated markers with jointly estimated effects. Results: Pruned scores tend to have slightly lower R2 than jointly modelled scores, but the differences are small at sample sizes up to 100,000. If the proportion of correlated variants is high, joint modelling can obtain modest improvements asymptotically. Conclusions: The small gains observed to date from joint modelling can be explained by sample size. As studies become larger, joint modelling will be useful for traits affected by many correlated variants, but the improvements may remain small. Pruning remains a useful heuristic for current studies.},

It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations σ1 and σ2, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.},

We find evidence that Aridoamerican and Mesoamerican populations diverged roughly 4–9.9 ka, around the time when sedentary farming started in Mesoamerica. Comparisons with ancient genomes indicate that the Upward Sun River 1 (USR1) individual is an outgroup to Mexican/South American Indigenous populations, whereas Anzick-1 was more closely related to Mesoamerican/South American populations than to those from Aridoamerica, showing an even more complex history of divergence than recognized so far.},

We have analysed 60 families with a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer for germline mutations in BRCA1. Twenty-two different mutations were detected in 32 families (53\%), of which 14 are previously unreported. We observed a significant correlation between the location of the mutation in the gene and the ratio of breast to ovarian cancer incidence within each family. Our data suggest a transition in risk such that mutations in the 3' third of the gene are associated with a lower proportion of ovarian cancer.

ApoL1 (apolipoprotein L-1) is a serum factor that lyses trypanosomes. In vitro assays revealed that only the kidney disease-associated ApoL1 variants lysed Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.

  abstract = {Importance There is limited population-based evidence on the prevalence of cognitive impairment in Mexico, a country with a rapidly aging population and where key risk factors, such as diabetes and obesity, are common. Objective To describe the distribution of cognitive impairment in a sample of adults from Mexico City. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional population-based study included participants from the Mexico City Prospective Study which 50,000 men and 100,000 women aged ≥35 years from two districts in 1998-2004. In 2015-2019 about 10,000 survivors were resurveyed with identical information from the original survey and additional assessments including a cognitive assessment. The main analyses included those aged 50-89 years with complete cognitive assessment and covariate data at resurvey. Main outcomes and measures Cognition was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and those with cognitive impairment (MMSE ≤24) were identified. The distribution of MMSE scores and cognitive impairment by age, sex, and major disease risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, and adiposity) was analyzed among those with complete MMSE data and some degree of self-reported formal education. Results Of the 9,288 participants aged 50-89 years at the 2015-2019 resurvey with complete data, 8,197 reported having at least some years of formal education. Among these (mean age 66 years; 31\% men), their mean MMSE score was 26.2 (SD 3.6) points, 1,941 (24\%) had cognitive impairment, mean body-mass index (BMI) was 28.6 (SD 5.5) kg/m2, 3,008 (37\%) had previously-diagnosed hypertension and 2,467 (30\%) had previously-diagnosed diabetes. The sex- and district-standardised prevalence of cognitive impairment increased strongly with age, from 10\% in those 50-59 years to 55\% in those aged 80-89. At any given age, the prevalence of cognitive impairment was higher in women than in men. After accounting for the effects of age, sex, and district there was little difference in the prevalence of cognitive impairment between participants with or without diabetes, hypertension, overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25 km/m2), or high levels of fat mass. Conclusion and relevance In this population of adults aged 50-89 years from two districts of Mexico City, the prevalence of cognitive impairment was high, particularly among women. The extent to which cognitive impairment relates to health outcomes in this population needs to be investigated. Question What is the distribution of cognitive impairment among adults in Mexico City?Findings In this cross-sectional study of 8,197 adults aged 50-89 years, the sex- and district-standardised prevalence of cognitive impairment ranged from 10\% in those 50-59 years to 55\% in those aged 80-89 and at any given age was higher in women than in men. There was little difference in the prevalence of cognitive impairment between participants with or without hypertension, diabetes or excess of adiposity.Meaning Cognitive impairment is common in adults in Mexico City. Its relevance to major morbidity and mortality deserves future research.},

  abstract = {The current debate over racial inequalities in health is arguably the most important venue for advancing both scientific and public understanding of race, racism, and human biological variation. In the United States and elsewhere, there are well-defined inequalities between racially defined groups for a range of biological outcomes-cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, certain cancers, low birth weight, preterm delivery, and others. Among biomedical researchers, these patterns are often taken as evidence of fundamental genetic differences between alleged races. However, a growing body of evidence establishes the primacy of social inequalities in the origin and persistence of racial health disparities. Here, I summarize this evidence and argue that the debate over racial inequalities in health presents an opportunity to refine the critique of race in three ways: 1) to reiterate why the race concept is inconsistent with patterns of global human genetic diversity; 2) to refocus attention on the complex, environmental influences on human biology at multiple levels of analysis and across the lifecourse; and 3) to revise the claim that race is a cultural construct and expand research on the sociocultural reality of race and racism. Drawing on recent developments in neighboring disciplines, I present a model for explaining how racial inequality becomes embodied-literally-in the biological well-being of racialized groups and individuals. This model requires a shift in the way we articulate the critique of race as bad biology.},

  abstract = {A goal of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to estimate the causal effects of alleles carried by an individual on that individual (‘direct genetic effects’). Typical GWAS designs, however, are susceptible to confounding due to gene-environment correlation and non-random mating (population stratification and assortative mating). Family-based GWAS, in contrast, is robust to such confounding since it uses random, within-family genetic variation. When both parents are genotyped, a regression controlling for parental genotype provides the most powerful approach. However, parental genotypes are often missing. We have previously shown that imputing the genotypes of missing parent(s) can increase power for estimation of direct genetic effects over using genetic differences between siblings. We extend the imputation method, which previously only applied to samples with at least one genotyped sibling or parent, to ‘singletons’ (individuals without any genotyped relatives). By including singletons, the effective sample size for estimation of direct effects can be increased by up to 50\%. We apply this method to 408,254 ‘White British’ individuals from the UK Biobank, obtaining an effective sample size increase of between 25\% and 43\% (depending upon phenotype) by including 368,629 singletons. While this approach maximizes power, it can be biased when there is strong population structure. We therefore introduce an imputation based estimator that is robust to population structure and more powerful than other robust estimators. We implement our estimators in the software package snipar using an efficient linear-mixed model (LMM) specified by a sparse genetic relatedness matrix. We examine the bias and variance of different family-based and standard GWAS estimators theoretically and in simulations with differing levels of population structure, enabling researchers to choose the appropriate approach depending on their research goals.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) has been increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational epidemiology. Methodological developments in the field allow detecting and/or adjusting for different potential sources of bias, mainly bias due to horizontal pleiotropy (or “off-target” genetic effects). Another potential source of bias is nonrandom matching between spouses (i.e., assortative mating). In this study, we performed simulations to investigate the bias caused in MR by assortative mating. We found that bias can arise due to either cross-trait assortative mating (i.e., assortment on two phenotypes, such as highly educated women selecting taller men) or single-trait assortative mating (i.e., assortment on a single phenotype), even if the exposure and outcome phenotypes are not the phenotypes under assortment. The simulations also indicate that bias due to assortative mating accumulates over generations and that MR methods robust to horizontal pleiotropy are also affected by this bias. Finally, we show that genetic data from mother–father–offspring trios can be used to detect and correct for this bias.},

Allelic association exact tests were calculated. Our most significant SNPs were compared with results from other type 2 diabetes genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Proportions of African, European, and Asian ancestry were estimated from the HapMap samples using structure for each individual to rule out spurious association due to population substructure.RESULTS—We observed more significant allelic associations than expected genome wide, as empirically assessed by permutation (14 below a P of 1 × 10−4 [8.7 expected]). No significant differences were observed between the proportion of ancestry estimates in the case and random control sets, suggesting that the association results were not likely confounded by substructure. A query of our top ∼1\% of SNPs (P \&lt; 0.01) revealed SNPs in or near four genes that showed evidence for association (P \&lt; 0.05) in multiple other GWAS interrogated: rs979752 and rs10500641 near UBQLNL and OR52H1 on chromosome 11, rs2773080 and rs3922812 in or near RALGPS2 on chromosome 1, and rs1509957 near EGR2 on chromosome 10.CONCLUSIONS—We identified several SNPs with suggestive evidence for replicated association with type 2 diabetes that merit further investigation.},

For the  model, when the proportion of assortative mating was high, positive linkage disequilibrium was generated. However, when the proportion of assortative mating was similar to that found in some studies, the amount of linkage disequilibrium was quite low. In addition, the amount of linkage disequilibrium was independent of the level of recombination. For two selective assortative models, the amount of linkage disequilibrium was a function of the amount of recombination. For these models, the linkage disequilibrium generated was negative mainly because repulsion heterozygotes were favored over coupling heterozygotes. From these findings, the impact of assortative mating on linkage disequilibrium, and consequently heritability and additive genetic variance, appears to be small and model-specific.},

However, we show that measurement error in the phenotypes can lead to the CIT inferring the wrong causal direction, and that increasing sample sizes has the adverse effect of increasing confidence in the wrong answer. This problem is likely to be general to other mediation-based approaches. Here we introduce an extension to Mendelian randomisation, a method that uses genetic associations in an instrumentation framework, that enables inference of the causal direction between traits, with some advantages. First, it can be performed using only summary level data from genome-wide association studies; second, it is less susceptible to bias in the presence of measurement error or unmeasured confounding. We apply the method to infer the causal direction between DNA methylation and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate that, in general, DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, but this result is highly susceptible to bias induced by systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms, and by horizontal pleiotropy. We emphasise that, where possible, implementing MR and appropriate sensitivity analyses alongside other approaches such as CIT is important to triangulate reliable conclusions about causality.},

  abstract = {Reducing body weight to improve metabolic health and related comorbidities is a primary goal in treating obesity1,2. However, maintaining weight loss is a considerable challenge, especially as the body seems to retain an obesogenic memory that defends against body weight changes3,4. Overcoming this barrier for long-term treatment success is difficult because the molecular mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Here, by using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we show that both human and mouse adipose tissues retain cellular transcriptional changes after appreciable weight loss. Furthermore, we find persistent obesity-induced alterations in the epigenome of~mouse adipocytes that~negatively affect their function and response to metabolic stimuli. Mice carrying this obesogenic memory show accelerated rebound weight gain, and the epigenetic memory can explain future transcriptional deregulation in adipocytes in response to further high-fat diet feeding. In summary, our findings indicate the existence of an obesogenic memory, largely on the basis of stable epigenetic changes, in mouse adipocytes and probably other cell types. These changes seem to prime cells for pathological responses in an obesogenic environment, contributing to the problematic ‘yo-yo’ effect often seen with dieting. Targeting these changes in the future could improve long-term weight management and health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Spousal comparisons have been proposed as a design that can both reduce confounding and estimate effects of the shared adulthood environment. However, assortative mating, the process by which individuals select phenotypically (dis)similar mates, could distort associations when comparing spouses. We evaluated the use of spousal comparisons, as in the within-spouse pair (WSP) model, for aetiological research such as genetic association studies. We demonstrated that the WSP model can reduce confounding but may be susceptible to collider bias arising from conditioning on assorted spouse pairs. Analyses using UK Biobank spouse pairs found that WSP genetic association estimates were smaller than estimates from random pairs for height, educational attainment, and BMI variants. Within-sibling pair estimates, robust to demographic and parental effects, were also smaller than random pair estimates for height and educational attainment, but not for BMI. WSP models, like other within-family models, may reduce confounding from demographic factors in genetic association estimates, and so could be useful for triangulating evidence across study designs to assess the robustness of findings. However, WSP estimates should be interpreted with caution due to potential collider bias.},

  abstract = {Estimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of unrelated individuals capture effects of inherited variation (direct effects), demography (population stratification, assortative mating) and relatives (indirect genetic effects). Family-based GWAS designs can control for demographic and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data from 178,086 siblings from 19 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) GWAS estimates for 25 phenotypes. Within-sibship GWAS estimates were smaller than population estimates for height, educational attainment, age at first birth, number of children, cognitive ability, depressive symptoms and smoking. Some differences were observed in downstream SNP heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses. For example, the within-sibship genetic correlation between educational attainment and body mass index attenuated towards zero. In contrast, analyses of most molecular phenotypes (for example, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) were generally consistent. We also found within-sibship evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller height. Here, we illustrate the importance of family-based GWAS data for phenotypes influenced by demographic and indirect genetic effects.},

  abstract = {‘The Apportionment of Human Diversity’ stands as a noteworthy intervention, both for the field of human population genetics as well as in the annals of public communication of science. Despite the widespread uptake of Lewontin's conclusion that racial classification is of ‘virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance’, the biomedical research community continues to grapple with whether and how best to account for race in its work. Nowhere is this struggle more apparent than in the latest attempts to translate genetic associations with complex disease risk to clinical use in the form of polygenic risk scores, or PRS. In this perspective piece, we trace current challenges surrounding the appropriate development and clinical application of PRS in diverse patient cohorts to ongoing difficulties deciding which facets of population structure matter, and for what reasons, to human health. Despite numerous analytical innovations, there are reasons that emerge from Lewontin's work to remain sceptical that accounting for population structure in the context of polygenic risk estimation will allow us to more effectively identify and intervene on the significant health disparities which plague marginalized populations around the world. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Celebrating 50 years since Lewontin's apportionment of human diversity’.},

  abstract = {Polygenic scores (PSs) are becoming a useful tool to identify individuals with high genetic risk for complex diseases, and several projects are currently testing their utility for translational applications. It is also tempting to use PSs to assess whether genetic variation can explain a part of the geographic distribution of a phenotype. However, it is not well known how the population genetic properties of the training and target samples affect the geographic distribution of PSs. Here, we evaluate geographic differences, and related biases, of PSs in Finland in a geographically well-defined sample of 2,376 individuals from the National FINRISK study. First, we detect geographic differences in PSs for coronary artery disease (CAD), rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, waist-hip ratio (WHR), body-mass index (BMI), and height, but not for Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Second, we use height as a model trait to thoroughly assess the possible population genetic biases in PSs and apply similar approaches to the other phenotypes. Most importantly, we detect suspiciously large accumulations of geographic differences for CAD, WHR, BMI, and height, suggesting bias arising from the population's genetic structure rather than from a direct genotype-phenotype association. This work demonstrates how sensitive the geographic patterns of current PSs are for small biases even within relatively homogeneous populations and provides simple tools to identify such biases. A thorough understanding of the effects of population genetic structure on PSs is essential for translational applications of PSs.},

Paternal and maternal polygenic scores have similar effects on educational attainment, but mothers contribute more than fathers to nutrition- and heath-related traits.},

However, the increasing number of GWAS summary statistics and the diversity of software tools available for their analysis can make it challenging for researchers to select the most appropriate tools for their specific needs. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available software tools and databases for GWAS summary statistics analysis. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify relevant software tools and databases. We categorized the tools and databases by their functionality, including data management, quality control, single-trait analysis, and multiple-trait analysis. We also compared the tools and databases based on their features, limitations, and user-friendliness. Our review identified a total of 305 functioning software tools and databases dedicated to GWAS summary statistics, each with unique strengths and limitations. We provide descriptions of the key features of each tool and database, including their input/output formats, data types, and computational requirements. We also discuss the overall usability and applicability of each tool for different research scenarios. This comprehensive review will serve as a valuable resource for researchers who are interested in using GWAS summary statistics to investigate the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases. By providing a detailed overview of the available tools and databases, we aim to facilitate informed tool selection and maximize the effectiveness of GWAS summary statistics analysis.},

  abstract = {Replicable genetic association signals have consistently been found through genome-wide association studies in recent years. The recent dramatic expansion of study sizes improves power of estimation of effect sizes, genomic prediction, causal inference, and polygenic selection, but it simultaneously increases susceptibility of these methods to bias due to subtle population structure. Standard methods using genetic principal components to correct for structure might not always be appropriate and we use a simulation study to illustrate when correction might be ineffective for avoiding biases. New methods such as trans-ethnic modeling and chromosome painting allow for a richer understanding of the relationship between traits and population structure. We illustrate the arguments using real examples (stroke and educational attainment) and provide a more nuanced understanding of population structure, which is set to be revisited as a critical aspect of future analyses in genetic epidemiology. We also make simple recommendations for how problems can be avoided in the future. Our results have particular importance for the implementation of GWAS meta-analysis, for prediction of traits, and for causal inference.},

This reveals a rich and detailed pattern of genetic differentiation with remarkable concordance between genetic clusters and geography. The regional genetic differentiation and differing patterns of shared ancestry with 6,209 individuals from across Europe carry clear signals of historical demographic events. We estimate the genetic contribution to southeastern England from Anglo-Saxon migrations to be under half, and identify the regions not carrying genetic material from these migrations. We suggest significant pre-Roman but post-Mesolithic movement into southeastern England from continental Europe, and show that in non-Saxon parts of the United Kingdom, there exist genetically differentiated subgroups rather than a general ‘Celtic’ population.},

  abstract = {Background Fish oil (FO), a mixture of omega-3 fatty acids mainly comprising docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), has been recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertriglyceridemia. However, its effects on lipidomic profiles and gut microbiota and the factors influencing triglyceride (TG) reduction remain unclear. Methods We conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 309 Chinese patients with T2D with hypertriglyceridemia (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03120299). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 4~g FO or corn oil for 12~weeks. The primary outcome was changes in serum TGs and the lipidomic profile, and the secondary outcome included changes in the gut microbiome and other metabolic variables. Findings The FO group had significantly better TG reduction (mean [95\% confidence interval (CI)]: −1.51 [−2.01, −1.01] mmol/L) compared to the corn oil group (−0.66 [−1.15, −0.16] mmol/L, p~= 0.02). FO significantly altered the serum lipid profile by reducing low-unsaturated TG species and increasing those containing DHA or EPA. FO had minor effects on gut microbiota, while baseline microbial features predicted the TG response to FO better than phenotypic or lipidomic features, potentially mediated by specific lipid metabolites. A total of 9 lipid metabolites significantly mediated the link between 4 baseline microbial variables and the TG response to FO supplementation. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate differential impacts of omega-3 fatty acids on lipidomic and microbial profiles in T2D and highlight the importance of baseline gut microbiota characteristics in predicting the TG-lowering efficacy of FO. Funding This study was funded by the National Nature Science Foundation.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have allowed the identification of disease-associated variants, which can be leveraged to build polygenic scores (PGSs). Even though PGSs can be a valuable tool in personalized medicine, their predictive power is limited in populations of non-European ancestry, particularly in admixed populations. Recent efforts have focused on increasing racial and ethnic diversity in GWAS, thus, addressing some of the limitations of genetic risk prediction in these populations. Even with these efforts, few studies focus exclusively on Hispanics/Latinos. Additionally, Hispanic/Latino populations are often considered a single population despite varying admixture proportions between and within ethnic groups, diverse genetic heterogeneity, and demographic history. Combined with highly heterogeneous environmental and socioeconomic exposures, this diversity can reduce the transferability of genetic risk prediction models. Given the recent increase of genomic studies that include Hispanics/Latinos, we review the milestones and efforts that focus on genetic risk prediction, summarize the potential for improving PGS transferability, and highlight the challenges yet to be addressed. Additionally, we summarize social-ethical considerations and provide ideas to promote genetic risk prediction models that can be implemented equitably.},

  abstract = {Objectives Genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) have become increasingly popular to identify associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypic traits. The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. Methods We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA\_tutorial/ )., In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual‐level scores of genetic risk. Results The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands‐on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users. Conclusions By providing theoretical background and hands‐on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are poised to improve biomedical outcomes via precision medicine. However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation of PRS is that those available today are several times more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric biases in genome-wide association studies, thus highlighting that—unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations—clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement for European-descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in leveling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date. To realize the full and equitable potential of PRS, greater diversity must be prioritized in genetic studies, and summary statistics must be publically disseminated to ensure that health disparities are not increased for those individuals already most underserved.},

We studied genomic variation within Mexico from over 1000 individuals representing 20 indigenous and 11 mestizo populations. We found striking genetic stratification among indigenous populations within Mexico at varying degrees of geographic isolation. Some groups were as differentiated as Europeans are from East Asians. Pre-Columbian genetic substructure is recapitulated in the indigenous ancestry of admixed mestizo individuals across the country. Furthermore, two independently phenotyped cohorts of Mexicans and Mexican Americans showed a significant association between subcontinental ancestry and lung function. Thus, accounting for fine-scale ancestry patterns is critical for medical and population genetic studies within Mexico, in Mexican-descent populations, and likely in many other populations worldwide.},

However, it is challenging to determine the biological mechanisms underlying most associations, and we lack genome-scale approaches for inferring causal mechanistic pathways from genes to cellular functions to traits. Here we propose new approaches to bridge this gap by combining quantitative estimates of gene-trait relationships from loss-of-function burden tests with gene-regulatory connections inferred from Perturb-seq experiments in relevant cell types. By combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological programs or direct effects on the trait. As a proof-of-concept, we constructed a causal graph of the gene regulatory hierarchy that jointly controls three partially co-regulated blood traits. We propose that perturbation studies in trait-relevant cell types, coupled with gene-level effect sizes for traits, can bridge the gap between genetics and biology.},

We identify communities at multiple resolutions, departing from typological models of analysis and interpretation that categorize individuals into a (predefined) number of sets.

This method embraces the context-specificity of genetic similarities that are salient depending on the question, markers of interest, and study individuals. Different numbers of communities are revealed depending on the resolution chosen and metric used, underscoring a fluid spectrum of genetic relationships and challenging the notion of universal categorization.

As sample sizes grow, so can genetic diversity leading to challenges in analyzing these data. Methods for empirically assigning individuals to genetically informed ancestry groups are needed. Methods We describe a strategy for empirically assigning ancestry groups in ethnically diverse GWAS data including extensions of principal component analysis (PCA) and population matching through minimum Mahalanobis distance. We apply these methods to data from Spit for Science (S4S): the University Student Survey, a study following college students longitudinally that includes genetic and environmental data on substance use and mental health (n = 7,603). Results The genetic-based population assignments for S4S were 48.7\% European, 22.5\% African, 10.4\% Americas, 9.2\% East Asian, and 9.2\% South Asian descent. Self-reported census categories “More than one race” and “Unknown”as well as “Hawaiian/Pacific Islander” and “American-Indian/Native Alaskan” were empirically assigned representing a +9\% sample retention over conventional methods. Although there was high concordance between self-reported race and empirical population-match (+.924), there was reduction in variance for most ancestry PCs for genetic-based population assignments. Conclusions We were able to create more genetically homogenous groups and reduce sample and marker loss through cross-ancestry meta-analysis, potentially increasing power to detect etiologically relevant variation. Our approach provides a framework for empirically assigning genetic ancestry groups which can be applied to other ethnically diverse genetic studies. Scientific Significance Given the important public health impact and demonstrable gains in statistical power from studying diverse populations, empirically sound practices for genetic studies are needed.

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.},

  abstract = {Human genetic studies of smoking behavior have been thus far largely limited to common variants. Studying rare coding variants has the potential to identify drug targets. We performed an exome-wide association study of smoking phenotypes in up to 749,459 individuals and discovered a protective association in CHRNB2, encoding the β2 subunit of the α4β2 nicotine acetylcholine receptor. Rare predicted loss-of-function and likely deleterious missense variants in CHRNB2 in aggregate were associated with a 35\% decreased odds for smoking heavily (odds ratio (OR)\,=\,0.65, confidence interval (CI)\,=\,0.56–0.76, P\,=\,1.9\,×\,10−8). An independent common variant association in the protective direction (rs2072659; OR\,=\,0.96; CI\,=\,0.94–0.98; P\,=\,5.3\,×\,10−6) was also evident, suggesting an allelic series. Our findings in humans align with decades-old experimental observations in mice that β2 loss abolishes nicotine-mediated neuronal responses and attenuates nicotine self-administration. Our genetic discovery will inspire future drug designs targeting CHRNB2 in the brain for the treatment of nicotine addiction.},

Estimated effects sizes are small (R2 ≈ 0.02\%), approximately 1 month of schooling per allele. A linear polygenic score from all measured SNPs accounts for ≈ 2\% of the variance in both educational attainment and cognitive function. Genes in the region of the loci have previously been associated with health, cognitive, and central nervous system phenotypes, and bioinformatics analyses suggest the involvement of the anterior caudate nucleus. These findings provide promising candidate SNPs for follow-up work, and our effect size estimates can anchor power analyses in social-science genetics.},

We demonstrate that ancIBD accurately identifies IBD segments {$>$}8\,cM for aDNA data with an average depth of {$>$}0.25× for whole-genome sequencing or {$>$}1× for 1240k single nucleotide polymorphism capture data. Applying ancIBD to 4,248 ancient Eurasian individuals, we identify relatives up to the sixth degree and genealogical connections between archaeological groups. Notably, we reveal long IBD sharing between Corded Ware and Yamnaya groups, indicating that the Yamnaya herders of the Pontic-Caspian Steppe and the Steppe-related ancestry in various European Corded Ware groups share substantial co-ancestry within only a few hundred years. These results show that detecting IBD segments can generate powerful insights into the growing aDNA record, both on a small scale relevant to life stories and on a large scale relevant to major cultural-historical events.},

The causes and genetic consequences of assortative mating remain un­re­solved because partner similarity can arise from different mechanisms: phenotypic assortment based on mate choice15,16, partner interaction and convergence in phenotype over time14,17, or social homogamy where individuals pair according to social or environmental background. Here, we present theory and an analytical approach to test for genetic evidence of assortative mating and find a correlation in genetic value among partners for a range of phenotypes. Across three independent samples of 24,662 spousal pairs in total, we infer a correlation at trait-associated loci between partners for height (0.200, 0.004 standard error, SE) that matched the phenotypic correlation (0.201, 0.004 SE), and a correlation at trait-associated loci for BMI (0.143, 0.007 SE) that was significantly lower than the phenotypic value (0.228, 0.004 SE). We extend our analysis to the UK Biobank study (7,780 pairs), finding evidence of a correlation at trait-associated loci for waist-to-hip ratio (0.101, 0.041 SE), systolic blood pressure (0.138, 0.064 SE) and educational attainment (0.654, 0.014 SE). Our results imply that mate choice, combined with widespread pleiotropy among traits, affects the genomic architecture of traits in humans.},

A key component to correcting for stratification in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is accurately identifying and controlling for the underlying structure present in the sample. Meta-analysis across cohorts is increasingly important for achieving very large sample sizes, but comes with the major disadvantage that each individual cohort corrects for different population stratification. Here we demonstrate that correcting for structure against an external reference adds significant value to meta-analysis. We treat the UK Biobank as a collection of smaller studies, each of which is geographically localised. We provide software to standardize an external dataset against a reference, provide the UK Biobank principal component loadings for this purpose, and demonstrate the value of this with an analysis of the geographically sampled ALSPAC cohort.},

  abstract = {Polygenic scores are a popular tool for prediction of complex traits. However, prediction estimates in samples of unrelated participants can include effects of population stratification, assortative mating, and environmentally mediated parental genetic effects, a form of genotype-environment correlation (rGE). Comparing genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) predictions in unrelated individuals with predictions between siblings in a within-family design is a powerful approach to identify these different sources of prediction. Here, we compared within- to between-family GPS predictions of eight outcomes (anthropometric, cognitive, personality, and health) for eight corresponding GPSs. The outcomes were assessed in up to 2,366 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study from age 12 to age 21. To account for family clustering, we used mixed-effects modeling, simultaneously estimating within- and between-family effects for target- and cross-trait GPS prediction of the outcomes. There were three main findings: (1) DZ twin GPS differences predicted DZ differences in height, BMI, intelligence, educational achievement, and ADHD symptoms; (2) target and cross-trait analyses indicated that GPS prediction estimates for cognitive traits (intelligence and educational achievement) were on average 60\% greater between families than within families, but this was not the case for non-cognitive traits; and (3) much of this within- and between-family difference for cognitive traits disappeared after controlling for family socio-economic status (SES), suggesting that SES is a major source of between-family prediction through rGE mechanisms. These results provide insights into the patterns by which rGE contributes to GPS prediction, while ruling out confounding due to population stratification and assortative mating.},

In this article we argue that genomic sovereignty is not about the “others” extracting and exploiting local “human genetic resources”, but developing and implementing the ethical, legal and administrative tools, based on transparency, openness and equal access to biological material, in order to build up a robust research networks. Being biological samples a scarce and valuable good, we conclude that controlling the access to this resource by means of the law, without a well implemented biobanking system and a clear scientific policy may lead to a situation where asymmetric relations are generated among research groups of the very same developing country. We would advice to those countries pretending to protect their biological samples and data from the outside, before developing laws against possible “intrusions”, they need to design strategies to promote equal and fair access to both resources paramount to biomedical research.},

  abstract = {Precision medicine in the epilepsies has gathered much attention, especially with gene discovery pushing forward new understanding of disease biology. Several targeted treatments are emerging, some with considerable sophistication and individual‐level tailoring. There have been rare achievements in improving short‐term outcomes in a few very select patients with epilepsy. The prospects for further targeted, repurposed, or novel treatments seem promising. Along with much‐needed success, difficulties are also arising. Precision treatments do not always work, and sometimes are inaccessible or do not yet exist. Failures of precision medicine may not find their way to broader scrutiny. Precision medicine is not a new concept: It has been boosted by genetics and is often focused on genetically determined epilepsies, typically considered to be driven in an individual by a single genetic variant. Often the mechanisms generating the full clinical phenotype from such a perceived single cause are incompletely understood. The impact of additional genetic variation and other factors that might influence the clinical presentation represent complexities that are not usually considered. Precision success and precision failure are usually equally incompletely explained. There is a need for more comprehensive evaluation and a more rigorous framework, bringing together information that is both necessary and sufficient to explain clinical presentation and clinical responses to precision treatment in a precision approach that considers the full picture not only of the effects of a single variant, but also of its genomic and other measurable environment, within the context of the whole person. As we may be on the brink of a treatment revolution, progress must be considered and reasoned: One possible framework is proposed for the evaluation of precision treatments.},

Before the introduction of this approach only a handful of common genetic variants showed consistent association for any phenotype. Using genome-wide association, scores of novel and unsuspected loci have been discovered and later replicated for many complex traits. The principle is to genotype a dense set of common genetic variants across the genomes of individuals with phenotypic differences and examine whether genotype is associated with phenotype. Because the last common human ancestor was relatively recent and recombination events are concentrated in focal hotspots, most common variation in the human genome can be surveyed using a few hundred thousand variants acting as proxies for ungenotyped variants. Here, we describe the different steps of genome-wide association studies and use a recent study as example.},

  abstract = {Polygenic scores (PGSs) are being rapidly adopted for trait prediction in the clinic and beyond. PGSs are often thought of as capturing the direct genetic effect of one’s genotype on their phenotype. However, because PGSs are constructed from population-level associations, they are influenced by factors other than direct genetic effects, including stratification, assortative mating, and dynastic effects (“SAD effects”). Our interpretation and application of PGSs may hinge on the relative impact of SAD effects, since they may often be environmentally or culturally mediated. We developed a method that estimates the proportion of variance in a PGS (in a given sample) that is driven by direct effects, SAD effects, and their covariance. We leverage a comparison of a PGS of interest based on a standard GWAS with a PGS based on a sibling GWAS—which is largely immune to SAD effects—to quantify the relative contribution of each type of effect to variance in the PGS of interest. Our method, Partitioning Genetic Scores Using Siblings (PGSUS, pron. “Pegasus”), breaks down variance components further by axes of genetic ancestry, allowing for a nuanced interpretation of SAD effects. In particular, PGSUS can detect stratification along major axes of ancestry as well as SAD variance that is “isotropic” with respect to axes of ancestry. Applying PGSUS, we found evidence of stratification in PGSs constructed using large meta-analyses of height and educational attainment as well as in a range of PGSs constructed using the UK Biobank. In some instances, a given PGS appears to be stratified along a major axis of ancestry in one prediction sample but not in another (for example, in comparisons of prediction in samples from different countries, or in ancient DNA vs. contemporary samples). Finally, we show that different approaches for adjustment for population structure in GWASs have distinct advantages with respect to mitigation of ancestry-axis-specific and isotropic SAD variance in PGS. Our study illustrates how family-based designs can be combined with standard population-based designs to guide the interpretation and application of genomic predictors.},

  abstract = {We examined more than 97,000 families from four neurodevelopmental disease cohorts and the UK Biobank to identify phenotypic and genetic patterns in parents contributing to neurodevelopmental disease risk in children. We identified within- and cross-disorder correlations between six phenotypes in parents and children, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (R~= 0.32–0.38, p~{$<~$}10−126). We also found that measures of sub-clinical autism features in parents are associated with several autism severity measures in children, including biparental mean Social Responsiveness Scale scores and proband Repetitive Behaviors Scale scores (regression coefficient~= 0.14, p~=~3.38~×~10−4). We further describe patterns of phenotypic similarity between spouses, where spouses show correlations for six neurological and psychiatric phenotypes, including a within-disorder correlation for depression (R~= 0.24–0.68, p~{$<~$}0.001) and a cross-disorder correlation between anxiety and bipolar disorder (R~= 0.09–0.22, p~{$<~$}10−92). Using a simulated population, we also found that assortative mating can lead to increases in disease liability over generations and the appearance of “genetic anticipation” in families carrying rare variants. We identified several families in a neurodevelopmental disease cohort where the proband inherited multiple rare variants in disease-associated genes from each of their affected parents. We further identified parental relatedness as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders through its inverse relationship with variant pathogenicity and propose that parental relatedness modulates disease risk by increasing genome-wide homozygosity in children (R~= 0.05–0.26, p~{$<~$}0.05). Our results highlight the utility of assessing parent phenotypes and genotypes toward predicting features in children who carry rare variably expressive variants and implicate assortative mating as a risk factor for increased disease severity in these families.},

  abstract = {The spatial distribution of genetic variants is jointly determined by geography, past demographic processes, natural selection, and its interplay with environmental variation. A fraction of these genetic variants are “causal alleles” that affect the manifestation of a complex trait. The effect exerted by these causal alleles on complex traits can be independent or dependent on the environment. Understanding the evolutionary processes that shape the spatial structure of causal alleles is key to comprehend the spatial distribution of complex traits. Natural selection, past population size changes, range expansions, consanguinity, assortative mating, archaic introgression, admixture, and the environment can alter the frequencies, effect sizes, and heterozygosities of causal alleles. This provides a genetic axis along which complex traits can vary. However, complex traits also vary along biogeographical and sociocultural axes which are often correlated with genetic axes in complex ways. The purpose of this review is to consider these genetic and environmental axes in concert and examine the ways they can help us decipher the variation in complex traits that is visible in humans today. This initiative necessarily implies a discussion of populations, traits, the ability to infer and interpret “genetic” components of complex traits, and how these have been impacted by adaptive events. In this review, we provide a history-aware discussion on these topics using both the recent and more distant past of our academic discipline and its relevant contexts.},

  abstract = {Latin America continues to be severely underrepresented in genomics research, and fine-scale genetic histories and complex trait architectures remain hidden owing to insufficient data1. To fill this gap, the Mexican Biobank project genotyped 6,057 individuals from 898 rural and urban localities across all 32 states in Mexico at~a resolution of 1.8 million genome-wide markers with linked complex trait and disease information creating a valuable nationwide genotype–phenotype database. Here, using ancestry deconvolution and inference of identity-by-descent segments, we inferred ancestral population sizes across Mesoamerican regions over time, unravelling Indigenous, colonial and postcolonial demographic dynamics2–6. We observed variation in runs of homozygosity among genomic regions with different ancestries reflecting distinct demographic histories and, in turn, different distributions of rare deleterious variants. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 22 complex traits and found that several traits are better predicted using the Mexican Biobank GWAS compared to the UK Biobank GWAS7,8. We identified genetic and environmental factors associating with trait variation, such as the length of the genome in runs of homozygosity as a predictor for body mass index, triglycerides, glucose and height. This study provides insights into the genetic histories of individuals in Mexico and dissects their complex trait architectures, both crucial for making precision and preventive medicine initiatives accessible worldwide.},

  abstract = {Rare coding variants that substantially affect function provide insights into the biology of a gene1–3. However, ascertaining the frequency of such variants requires large sample sizes4–8. Here we present a catalogue of human protein-coding variation, derived from exome sequencing of 983,578 individuals across diverse populations. In total, 23\% of the Regeneron Genetics Center Million Exome (RGC-ME) data come from individuals of African, East Asian, Indigenous American, Middle Eastern and South Asian ancestry. The catalogue includes more than 10.4\,million missense and 1.1\,million predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants. We identify individuals with rare biallelic pLOF variants in 4,848 genes, 1,751 of which have not been previously reported. From precise quantitative estimates of selection against heterozygous loss of function (LOF), we identify 3,988 LOF-intolerant genes, including 86 that were previously assessed as tolerant and 1,153 that lack established disease annotation. We also define regions of missense depletion at high resolution. Notably, 1,482 genes have regions that are depleted of missense variants despite being tolerant of pLOF variants. Finally, we estimate that 3\% of individuals have a clinically actionable genetic variant, and that 11,773 variants reported in ClinVar with unknown significance are likely to be deleterious cryptic splice sites. To facilitate variant interpretation and genetics-informed precision medicine, we make this resource of coding variation from the RGC-ME dataset publicly accessible through a variant allele frequency browser.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered thousands of replicable genetic associations, guiding drug target discovery and powering genetic prediction of human phenotypes and diseases. However, genetic associations can be affected by gene-environment correlations and non-random mating, which can lead to biased inferences in downstream analyses. Family-based GWAS (FGWAS) uses the natural experiment of random assignment of genotype within families to separate out the contribution of direct genetic effects (DGEs) — causal effects of alleles in an individual on an individual — from other factors contributing to genetic associations. Here, we report results from an FGWAS meta-analysis of 34 phenotypes from 17 cohorts. We found evidence that factors uncorrelated with DGEs make substantial contributions to genetic associations for 27 phenotypes, with population stratification confounding — a form of gene-environment correlation — likely the major cause. By estimating SNP heritability and genetic correlations using DGEs, we found evidence that assortative mating has led to overestimation of SNP heritability for 5 phenotypes and overestimation of the degree of shared genetic effects (pleiotropy) between 22 pairs of phenotypes. Polygenic predictors constructed from DGEs are particularly useful for studying natural selection, assortative mating, and indirect genetic effects (effects of relatives’ genes mediated through the family environment). We validate our meta-analysis results by predicting phenotypes in hold-out samples using polygenic predictors constructed from DGEs, achieving statistically significant out-of-sample prediction for 24 phenotypes with little attenuation of predictive power within-families. We provide FGWAS summary statistics for 34 phenotypes that can be used for downstream analyses. Our study provides both a template for performing FGWAS and an argument for its value for debiasing inferences and understanding the impact of environment and mating patterns.},

The recent application of GWAS to clinic-based cohorts has also yielded genetic predictors of clinical outcomes. Regardless of context, the practical utility of this information will ultimately depend upon the quality of the original data. Quality control (QC) procedures for GWAS are computationally intensive, operationally challenging, and constantly evolving. With each new dataset, new realities are discovered about GWAS data and best practices continue to be developed. The Genomics Workgroup of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) funded electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network has invested considerable effort in developing strategies for QC of these data. The lessons learned by this group will be valuable for other investigators dealing with large scale genomic datasets. Here we enumerate some of the challenges in QC of GWAS data and describe the approaches that the eMERGE network is using for quality assurance in GWAS data, thereby minimizing potential bias and error in GWAS results. In this protocol we discuss common issues associated with QC of GWAS data, including data file formats, software packages for data manipulation and analysis, sex chromosome anomalies, sample identity, sample relatedness, population substructure, batch effects, and marker quality. We propose best practices and discuss areas of ongoing and future research.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) test hundreds of thousands of genetic variants across many genomes to find those statistically associated with a specific trait or disease. This methodology has generated a myriad of robust associations for a range of traits and diseases, and the number of associated variants is expected to grow steadily as GWAS sample sizes increase. GWAS results have a range of applications, such as gaining insight into a phenotype’s underlying biology, estimating its heritability, calculating genetic correlations, making clinical risk predictions, informing drug development programmes and inferring potential causal relationships between risk factors and health outcomes. In this Primer, we provide the reader with an introduction to GWAS, explaining their statistical basis and how they are conducted, describe state-of-the art approaches and discuss limitations and challenges, concluding with an overview of the current and future applications for GWAS results.},

  abstract = {Experts have widely promoted developing country investment in national genome projects in order to ensure their inclusion in medical genomic advances, to protect their genomes from foreign exploitation, and to foster their participation in a future genomics-based bioeconomy.~ In this context, the Mexican federal government’s investments to establish the National Institute of Genomic Medicine in 2004, that institute’s subsequent efforts to map the “Mexican genome” between 2004 and 2009, and the passage of legislation in 2008 to protect Mexico’s “genomic sovereignty” drew attention as the most comprehensive national genomics program among the world’s emerging economies. Given the prominence of Mexico’s decision to pursue its “national genome” and to understand how this approach to science policy has unfolded with time, we track major developments in the field of genomic medicine in Mexico and the trajectory of the “Mexican genome” over the last decade.~ Rather than the nation-state bound “Mexican genome,” we show that flexibility and ambiguity with regard to genomic identity has been instrumental amid the increasingly transnational and public-private nature of this scientific field. Over the last decade, Mexican samples have frequently been re-branded as the source of flexible, panethnic “Latino” or “Latin American” DNA.},

  abstract = {A central aim of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to estimate direct genetic effects: the causal effects on an individual’s phenotype of the alleles that they carry. However, estimates of direct effects can be subject to genetic and environmental confounding and can also absorb the “indirect” genetic effects of relatives’ genotypes. Recently, an important development in controlling for these confounds has been the use of within-family GWASs, which, because of the randomness of mendelian segregation within pedigrees, are often interpreted as producing unbiased estimates of direct effects. Here, we present a general theoretical analysis of the influence of confounding in standard population-based and within-family GWASs. We show that, contrary to common interpretation, family-based estimates of direct effects can be biased by genetic confounding. In humans, such biases will often be small per-locus, but can be compounded when effect-size estimates are used in polygenic scores (PGSs). We illustrate the influence of genetic confounding on population- and family-based estimates of direct effects using models of assortative mating, population stratification, and stabilizing selection on GWAS traits. We further show how family-based estimates of indirect genetic effects, based on comparisons of parentally transmitted and untransmitted alleles, can suffer substantial genetic confounding. We conclude that, while family-based studies have placed GWAS estimation on a more rigorous footing, they carry subtle issues of interpretation that arise from confounding.},

In this review, we describe how GWAS have informed the genetic architecture of cardiovascular diseases and the insights they have provided into disease pathophysiology, using archetypal conditions for both common and rare diseases. We also describe how biobank data sets can complement disease-specific studies, particularly for rarer cardiovascular diseases, and how findings from GWAS have the potential to impact on clinical care.

To date, most GWAS have been conducted in populations of European ancestry, which limits the use of GWAS-derived PGS in non-European ancestry populations. Here, we derive a theoretical model of the relative accuracy (RA) of PGS across ancestries. We show through extensive simulations that the RA of PGS based on genome-wide significant SNPs can be predicted accurately from modelling linkage disequilibrium (LD), minor allele frequencies (MAF), cross-population correlations of causal SNP effects and heritability. We find that LD and MAF differences between ancestries can explain between 70 and 80\% of the loss of RA of European-based PGS in African ancestry for traits like body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Our results suggest that causal variants underlying common genetic variation identified in European ancestry GWAS are mostly shared across continents.},

  abstract = {We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in linear regression, with a particular focus on quantifying uncertainty in which variables should be selected. The approach is based on a new model—the ‘sum of single effects’ model, called ‘SuSiE’—which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of ‘single-effect’ vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure—iterative Bayesian stepwise selection (IBSS)—which is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods but, instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under SuSiE. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a credible set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outperform existing methods for this task, and we illustrate their application to fine mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable-selection problems.},

Second, we investigate how mixed models can correct confounders in GWAS, which is widely accepted as an advantage of LMMs over traditional methods.

In addition to replicating previous findings, we identified a novel locus associated with type 2 diabetes at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P = 3.9 × 10(-13); odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with type 2 diabetes, and replicated in independent samples (P = 1.1 × 10(-4); OR = 1.20). The risk haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present at \textasciitilde 50\% frequency in Native American samples and \textasciitilde 10\% in east Asian, but is rare in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated that the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals. The SLC16A11 messenger RNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11 in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase in intracellular triacylglycerol levels. Despite type 2 diabetes having been well studied by genome-wide association studies in other populations, analysis in Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate gene for type 2 diabetes with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism.},

  abstract = {Associations between genotype and phenotype derive from four sources: direct genetic effects, indirect genetic effects from relatives, population stratification, and correlations with other variants affecting the phenotype through assortative mating. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of unrelated individuals have limited ability to distinguish the different sources of genotype-phenotype association, confusing interpretation of results and potentially leading to bias when those results are applied – in genetic prediction of traits, for example. With genetic data on families, the randomisation of genetic material during meiosis can be used to distinguish direct genetic effects from other sources of genotype-phenotype association. Genetic data on siblings is the most common form of genetic data on close relatives. We develop a method that takes advantage of identity-by-descent sharing between siblings to impute missing parental genotypes. Compared to no imputation, this increases the effective sample size for estimation of direct genetic effects and indirect parental effects by up to one third and one half respectively. We develop a related method for imputing missing parental genotypes when a parent-offspring pair is observed. We provide the imputation methods in a software package, SNIPar (single nucleotide imputation of parents), that also estimates genome-wide direct and indirect effects of SNPs. We apply this to a sample of 45,826 White British individuals in the UK Biobank who have at least one genotyped first degree relative. We estimate direct and indirect genetic effects for ∼5 million genome-wide SNPs for five traits. We estimate the correlation between direct genetic effects and effects estimated by standard GWAS to be 0.61 (S.E. 0.09) for years of education, 0.68 (S.E. 0.10) for neuroticism, 0.72 (S.E. 0.09) for smoking initiation, 0.87 (S.E. 0.04) for BMI, and 0.96 (S.E. 0.01) for height. These results suggest that GWAS based on unrelated individuals provides an inaccurate picture of direct genetic effects for certain human traits.},

  abstract = {Population stratification continues to bias the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). When these results are used to construct polygenic scores, even subtle biases can cumulatively lead to large errors. To study the effect of residual stratification, we simulated GWAS under realistic models of demographic history. We show that when population structure is recent, it cannot be corrected using principal components of common variants because they are uninformative about recent history. Consequently, polygenic scores are biased in that they recapitulate environmental structure. Principal components calculated from rare variants or identity-by-descent segments can correct this stratification for some types of environmental effects. While family-based studies are immune to stratification, the hybrid approach of ascertaining variants in GWAS but reestimating effect sizes in siblings reduces but does not eliminate stratification. We show that the effect of population stratification depends not only on allele frequencies and environmental structure but also on demographic history.},

  abstract = {Epidemiologic associations estimated from observational data are often confounded by genetics due to pervasive pleiotropy among complex traits. Many studies either neglect genetic confounding altogether or rely on adjusting for polygenic scores (PGS) in regression analysis. In this study, we unveil that the commonly employed PGS approach is inadequate for removing genetic confounding due to measurement error and model misspecification. To tackle this challenge, we introduce PENGUIN, a principled framework for polygenic genetic confounding control based on variance component estimation. In addition, we present extensions of this approach that can estimate genetically-unconfounded associations using GWAS summary statistics alone as input and between multiple generations of study samples. Through simulations, we demonstrate superior statistical properties of PENGUIN compared to the existing approaches. Applying our method to multiple population cohorts, we reveal and remove substantial genetic confounding in the associations of educational attainment with various complex traits and between parental and offspring education. Our results show that PENGUIN is an effective solution for genetic confounding control in observational data analysis with broad applications in future epidemiologic association studies.},

  abstract = {The Mexico City Prospective Study is a prospective cohort of more than 150,000 adults recruited two decades ago from the urban districts of Coyoacán and Iztapalapa in Mexico City1. Here we generated genotype and exome-sequencing data for all individuals and whole-genome sequencing data for 9,950 selected individuals. We describe high levels of relatedness and substantial heterogeneity in ancestry composition across individuals. Most sequenced individuals had admixed Indigenous American, European and African ancestry, with extensive admixture from Indigenous populations in central, southern and southeastern Mexico. Indigenous Mexican segments of the genome had lower levels of coding variation but an excess of homozygous loss-of-function variants compared with segments of African and European origin. We estimated ancestry-specific allele frequencies at 142\,million genomic variants, with an effective sample size of 91,856 for Indigenous Mexican ancestry at exome variants, all available through a public browser. Using whole-genome sequencing, we developed an imputation reference panel that outperforms existing panels at common variants in individuals with high proportions of central, southern and southeastern Indigenous Mexican ancestry. Our work illustrates the value of genetic studies in diverse populations and provides foundational imputation and allele frequency resources for future genetic studies in Mexico and in the United States, where the Hispanic/Latino population is predominantly of Mexican descent.},
